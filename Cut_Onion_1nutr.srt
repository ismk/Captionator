Hi, I'm registered
dietitian nutritionist,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,330
Sara Haas with the Academy
of Nutrition and Dietetics.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,500
Onions are a stable in nearly
every cultural cuisine.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,640
But this aromatic
superstar has a knack

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,150
for making the cook cry.

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,730
That's because when
you cut an onion,

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,906
it releases gases into the air
that can irritate our eyes.

10
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:29,360
Here are some tricks on how
to cut an onion without tears.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,159
You can open a nearby
window, light a candle,

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,680
or wear protective eye wear.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,560
Another easy tip
is to keep the cut

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,700
side of onion flat
against the board

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,730
to help keep it from
releasing mist into the air

16
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,938
while you're working with it.

17
00:00:40,938 --> 00:00:42,760
There are also
special kitchen tools

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,960
designed for chopping onions
and containing the oils.

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,760
No matter which
method you choose,

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,370
always be sure to wash your
hands in hot, soapy water

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,210
to prevent the oil from
getting on your eyes and face.

22
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,730
And that's how you cut
an onion without tears.

23
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,900
