JENNIFER ISERLOH: Asparagus is
a cleansing spring vegetable

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,130
that can make a tasty
side dish or star

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,910
in your favorite main dish.

5
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,630
It's also great for
digestive health.

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,110
Asparagus is prebiotic, meaning
it feeds the helpful bacteria

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,680
that live in your gut.

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,000
These good bacteria are
responsible for everything

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,600
from signaling
your immune system

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,670
and keeping digestion in check,
to producing vital B vitamins.

11
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,350
When shopping for
asparagus, look

12
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,620
for spears that are free
of blemishes and dry spots,

13
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,100
and look for tips that
are closed and firm.

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,880
Use asparagus promptly--
it can spoil quickly.

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,020
Miso asparagus is
an easy side dish

16
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,820
that can also be
served as a main dish

17
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,780
when served over salad
or with sliced chicken.

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,480
Miso is a paste made
from fermented soybeans.

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,250
Find it at health and
Asian food stores.

20
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,330
Start by trimming off the
tough ends of the asparagus.

21
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,930
Next, warm the sesame oil in a
large skillet over medium heat.

22
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,850
Add the asparagus and cook four
to five minutes, turning often

23
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,400
until the asparagus
softens and browns.

24
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,720
Place one tablespoon of
miso paste in a large bowl.

25
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,780
Next, whisk together ginger,
garlic, and two tablespoons

26
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,970
of warm water.

27
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,850
Then just pour over
the cooked asparagus,

28
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,900
sprinkle with sesame
seeds, and enjoy.
