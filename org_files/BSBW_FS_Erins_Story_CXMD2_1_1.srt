00:00:03,374 --> 00:00:06,554
MATT: We were having a good
time, waiting for the big day.

3
00:00:06,554 --> 00:00:08,220
When they told us
that she had listeria,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,522
we had no idea what it
was, absolutely no clue.

5
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:15,660
ERIN: Matt and I wanted a child.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,820
We gave ourselves a
three-month window.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,060
And lo and behold,
we got pregnant.

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,270
At my baby shower,
we had just a handful

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,040
of girlfriends, presents,
cake, fruit, vegetables,

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,830
and the lovely cheese tray.

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,520
MATT: It started,
I think, on Monday.

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,549
By Wednesday, she had a fever.

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,140
It was 102.4.

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,440
Doctor said, take her
to the emergency room.

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,450
They checked the baby.

16
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,496
Allison was in distress.

17
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:39,620
Her heartbeat was dropping.

18
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,317
ERIN: And that's when
they said, you're

19
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:42,525
going to have a baby tonight.

20
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:45,490
And I was like,
I'm only 33 weeks.

21
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,050
You have this
frail little being,

22
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,765
and she's got eight tubes
running in and out of her.

23
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:54,710
ERIN: She was considered septic.

24
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,290
They had to do rounds of massive
antibiotics 24 hours a day.

25
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,900
It wasn't until
afterwards I learned--

26
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,680
you stay away from your deli
meats, your soft cheeses.

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,395
I didn't know that it could
harbor pathogens like listeria.

28
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:11,550

29
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:18,190
Allison today is headstrong,
feisty, a spitfire,

30
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,730
and the light of my life.

31
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,580
She's strong.

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,780
And that's what I love.

33
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,690
Looking at me when
I was in the NICU,

34
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,680
you see tubes and
monitors and everything.

35
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,500
I feel lucky that I am alive.

36
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,190
Listeria caused prematurity.

37
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,140
It runs its own game.

38
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,520
It's harder for me
to learn, but I'm

39
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,140
catching up to the other kids.

40
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,080
MATT: Today she's very
much a normal teenager.

41
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,050
And if you can't play
softball, she's miserable.

42
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:51,542
[CHEERING]

43
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:55,800
Food safety, for me, is pay
attention to your recalls,

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,950
first and foremost.

45
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,270
Pay attention to your
cooking temperature,

46
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,400
when it comes to your
poultry, steak, hamburger.

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,610
We check everything we buy.

48
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,292
C We make sure it's in date.

49
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,500
ALLISON: Every time we get
new vegetables and things,

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,070
mom washes them immediately.

51
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,200
ERIN: For a pregnant mom,
pay attention to the doctor's

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,210
list of foods to stay away from.

53
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,440
But not everybody
understands to stay away

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,960
from your deli meats,
unpasteurized cheese,

55
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,690
and soft cheese.

56
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,270
Being a food-borne
illness survivor,

57
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,050
knowing that my
child almost died,

58
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,580
you don't take a
day for granted.
